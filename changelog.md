## Changelog - v1.5 - 24th May 2020
We are back! Sorry that we have been gone so long, however we are happy to announce the recent changes:

* Cleaned the code up, including removing short open tags, which caused issues on some web hosts
* Added MerlinWP - when installing the theme you are now guided through an installation wizard which will install a child theme, install required plugins and import demo content (optional)
* New demo content - out with the old and in with the new. Demo content completely cleaned up which better shows the theme features.
* WordPress.org submission - We are getting ready to submit our theme to WordPress.org! You may see more changes coming while we prepare for this!
